Matrix Transpose Calculation With Multithreading and Data &amp; Task Parallelism Techniques on Matrix

This repository contains two examples demonstrating the use of multithreading in C:

## 🧵 Files

- **data_parallelism.c**: Demonstrates data parallelism using pthreads.
- **task_parallelism.c**: Demonstrates task parallelism using pthreads.

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

### Compile

```bash
gcc -pthread data_parallelism.c -o data_parallelism
gcc -pthread task_parallelism.c -o task_parallelism
